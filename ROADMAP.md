# Message-Service — ROADMAP

This document has two parts:

1. **Upcoming v1 increments** — the planned next steps within v1 scope. Order is the current best guess; subject to team re-prioritization.
2. **Deferred from v1** — items explicitly carved out of v1 during requirements elicitation, retained here for the rationale and the trigger that would prompt reconsideration. Items in this section are **not** requirements; promotion to a future release moves them into `docs/L1-REQ.md` with a fresh requirement identifier.

---

## Part 1 — Upcoming v1 increments

Last full increment merged: **16 — local-account auth adapter (Argon2 + sessions)** (commit `7ede66c`).

### Status snapshot (as of 2026-04-25)

Done:

- **Cluster 14 (sweeper hardening + test isolation)** — 14a `04a88dc`, 14b.1 `460d127`, 14b.2 `7c33c87`, 14b.3 `3b48d38`, 14b.4 `5456f2e`, 14c.1 `9b28e2b`, 14c.2 `3fd0673`, 14d `4b24818`, 14e `fb54f98`, 14f `1cdfc3d`, 14h `1b14b92`. 14g superseded by 25a; 14c.3 obviated by 14b's post-transition fetch.
- **Cluster 25 (requirements spec cleanup)** — 25a `1f26f2f`, 25b `eb5f537`, 25c `c5b9854`, 25d `3f45426`, 25e `d67539a`, 25f `5614aa8`.
- **Cluster 26 (CI/CD requirements + workflows)** — 26a `220c1d5`, 26b `c22ebc9`, 26c `f99f795`, 26d `aa6550c`.
- **Increment 15** — Prometheus metrics adapter (`fe5c3a4`).
- **Increment 16** — Local-account auth adapter, Argon2 + sessions (`7ede66c`).
- **Increment 17** — FastAPI app factory + bootstrap wiring (`aa3902e`).
- **Increment 18** — Subscription CRUD routes (`310ce2d`).
- **Increment 19a** — Past-runs paginated list + run-detail metadata view (`9b0a87b`).
- **Increment 19b** — Manual resend (re-renders from saved Stage context) (`f3d7509`).
- **Increment 19c** — Filesystem report store + report viewer; closes L1-DASH-003 (`b900ce3`).

Still open:

- **Increments 20–24** — Admin surfaces, E2E happy-path + orphan-path harness, error-mapping coverage, deployment polish, documentation deliverables. See sections below; sequencing refreshed at the bottom.

The list below is keyed off `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md` (now authoritative for status, per 25a) and the empty source/test directories under `src/message_service/interfaces/rest/{auth,routes}/`, `tests/e2e/`, and `docs/adr/`.

Re-order freely. Each item names the requirement category it closes so trace-matrix impact is visible.

The completed-increment sections (14a–f, 25a–e, 26a–d) are retained below as historical record. They describe the rationale for each landed change; future readers may find them useful as ADR-adjacent context.

### Increment 14a — Default sweeper config aligned with implemented handlers  *(✅ done — commit `04a88dc`)*

**Problem**

The schema default and shipped config reference a handler that is not implemented:

- `src/message_service/config/schema.py:184` — `disposition_actions` defaults to `["SEND_PARTIAL_FLAGGED", "NOTIFY_ADMINS"]`.
- `config/default.toml:47` mirrors that default.
- `src/message_service/bootstrap/service.py:271-276` registers `SendPartialFlaggedHandler` under that action id.
- `src/message_service/infrastructure/sweeper/handlers.py:100-105` (and `NotifySubscribersHandler` at `:117-122`) raise `NotImplementedError`.
- `config/config.toml.example:103-106` correctly documents both as "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED -- will raise" and ships `["NOTIFY_ADMINS", "DISCARD_SILENTLY"]`.

A service started with the default config hits `NotImplementedError` on every orphaned run. The L3-SWEEP-013 "handlers SHALL NOT raise — failures logged at ERROR and swallowed" contract converts this from a crash to a silent guaranteed-failure on every disposition. The shipped example config and the runtime default disagree.

**Work** (in order — defense in depth)

1. Change the schema default and `config/default.toml` to match the example: `["NOTIFY_ADMINS", "DISCARD_SILENTLY"]`. Two-line fix.
2. Make `bootstrap/service.py` register only handlers that are actually implemented. The two placeholders (`SendPartialFlaggedHandler`, `NotifySubscribersHandler`) should not be in the `handlers_by_id` dict at all until they have real implementations.
3. Reuse the L3-SWEEP-012 pattern: configs that reference an unregistered action id raise `ConfigurationError` at startup listing the unknown name and the allowed (registered) set. The `SweeperUseCase` constructor's existing validation already validates against `handlers_by_id` — once step 2 lands, that check now correctly rejects misconfiguration before the service starts accepting traffic, instead of failing per-orphan at runtime.
4. Add a conformance test that every action id in the schema's *default* `disposition_actions` is registered in bootstrap's `handlers_by_id` — prevents this drift from recurring.

**Verification**

- Unit: `Config.model_validate({})` produces a sweeper config whose every action id maps to a non-placeholder handler.
- Unit: starting bootstrap with a config that references `"SEND_PARTIAL_FLAGGED"` raises `ConfigurationError` at startup, not at first orphan.
- Conformance: schema default ⊆ bootstrap registered ids.

When `SEND_PARTIAL_FLAGGED` and `NOTIFY_SUBSCRIBERS` are actually implemented (Part 2 may eventually demand them), reverse step 2 and update the conformance test.

### Increment 14b — Sweeper exactly-once: atomic transition + outbox table  *(✅ done — commits `460d127`, `7c33c87`, `3b48d38`, `5456f2e`)*

Closes the real gap behind **L2-SWEEP-006**, which is currently mis-rolled-up as Implemented in `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md:177` even though its L3 children (`L3-SWEEP-009`, `L3-SWEEP-010`) are still Draft.

**Problem**

- `src/message_service/application/use_cases/sweeper.py:199` transitions the run to `ORPHANED`, commits, then dispatches handlers afterward. The inline comment ("Dispatch AFTER commit … best-effort beyond that boundary") contradicts L2-SWEEP-006's atomic-enqueue contract.
- A crash between the commit and the dispatch loses dispositions silently; a sweeper retry after the same crash window re-fires handlers — no exactly-once guarantee.
- L3-SWEEP-010 mandates a `sweeper_actions` outbox table that the assembly task consumes from. It does not exist; handlers are invoked directly in-process.

**Work**

- Add a `sweeper_actions` table in a new migration: `(action_id PK, run_id, action_name, enqueued_at, claimed_at NULL, completed_at NULL, attempts, last_error)`. Index on `(claimed_at IS NULL, enqueued_at)`.
- In one UoW, perform: the conditional `UPDATE runs SET state='ORPHANED' WHERE state IN (...) AND run_id=?` (per L3-SWEEP-009 — zero affected rows means race lost, skip silently), the audit insert, **and** one `sweeper_actions` insert per configured disposition action. Commit them together.
- Replace the in-tick handler dispatch with a separate `SweeperActionDispatcher` (in `application/use_cases/`) that the existing `SweeperLoop` ticks alongside the orphan scan. The dispatcher claims pending rows via `UPDATE … RETURNING` (or `UPDATE … WHERE claimed_at IS NULL` then `SELECT changes()`), runs the handler, and stamps `completed_at` (or bumps `attempts` + records `last_error`).
- L3-SWEEP-013's "handlers SHALL NOT raise" still applies — failures stay logged + swallowed, but now they're recorded on the action row so the dispatcher can decide retry vs. give up.

**Verification**

- Unit: atomic-update returns 0 rows when the run state isn't eligible; the UoW rolls back the action inserts on failure.
- Integration: kill the dispatcher between claim and complete, restart, confirm the action runs exactly once (covers the crash-mid-dispatch case the current code can't handle).
- Promotes `L2-SWEEP-006`, `L3-SWEEP-009`, `L3-SWEEP-010` from Draft → Implemented; correct the rollup in `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`.

**Trace-matrix correction (do alongside, not after)**

The current entry for L2-SWEEP-006 should be downgraded to Draft until this increment lands, so the matrix doesn't claim a guarantee the code doesn't deliver. `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py` regenerates the file; the misclassification is upstream of that — likely a marker on a sweeper test that needs removing or retargeting. Audit the markers under `tests/integration/test_sweeper_pipeline.py` and `tests/unit/.../sweeper*` for `@pytest.mark.requirement("L2-SWEEP-006")` claims that don't actually verify atomicity.

### Increment 14c — Sweeper conformance fixes  *(✅ 14c.1 `9b28e2b`, 14c.2 `3fd0673`; 14c.3 obviated by 14b's post-transition fetch)*

Three smaller deviations from the SWEEP requirements that don't fit inside 14a or 14b but should land before the sweeper category is declared done.

**14c.1 — Permit empty `disposition_actions` (L3-SWEEP-011)**

L3-SWEEP-011 (`docs/L3-REQ.md:437`) says "Empty `disposition_actions` SHALL be permitted, causing orphaned runs to receive no action beyond the state transition (equivalent to `DISCARD_SILENTLY`)". Today:

- `src/message_service/config/schema.py:184` enforces `min_length=1`.
- `tests/unit/config/test_schema.py:227-232` asserts the *opposite* — empty is rejected.

L2-SWEEP-007 is currently rolled up as Implemented in the trace matrix despite this contradiction with one of its L3 children.

**Work**: drop `min_length=1`, invert the schema test to assert that an empty list is accepted and produces a config whose orphaned-run path becomes a no-op transition. Confirm the `SweeperUseCase`'s handler-validation step doesn't trip on the empty list (it iterates configured ids; an empty iter is fine).

**14c.2 — Rename metric to match L3-SWEEP-004**

L3-SWEEP-004 (`docs/L3-REQ.md:416`) mandates `message_service_sweeper_iterations_total`. The code declares `message_service_sweeper_ticks_total` (`src/message_service/infrastructure/sweeper/loop.py:51`) and the test (`tests/unit/infrastructure/sweeper/test_loop.py:294`) asserts the wrong name.

**Work**: rename the `Counter` and the test assertion. No external dashboards exist yet, so this is a free rename now and a forced migration later. The `outcome` label values (`no_orphans_found`, `orphans_detected`, `sweeper_error`) already match the requirement.

**14c.3 — Hand the post-transition `Run` aggregate to handlers**

`application/ports/disposition_handler.py:52-56` documents the parameter as the run *after* transition to `ORPHANED`. `application/use_cases/sweeper.py:202` passes `candidate` — the pre-transition snapshot from `list_expired`. Current handlers happen not to read mutable fields, so the bug is latent.

**Work**: have `_transition_and_audit` return the post-commit `Run` (load it fresh inside the same UoW after the conditional update), and pass that to `_dispatch_handlers` instead of `candidate`.

**Sequencing note vs. 14b**: 14b moves dispatch out of the tick path entirely (handlers run from the `sweeper_actions` outbox dispatcher, not in-process after commit). When 14b lands, the dispatcher will fetch the run fresh anyway, so 14c.3 becomes redundant in that path. If 14b is going to ship soon, skip 14c.3 and let 14b handle it. If 14b is more than a sprint out, do 14c.3 now — it's a small, contained fix and the latent bug is real. 14c.1 and 14c.2 stand independent of 14b.

### Increment 14d — Stuck-claim recovery for the sweeper outbox  *(✅ done — commit `4b24818`)*

**Problem**

`SweeperActionDispatcherUseCase.dispatch_pending` claims rows in phase 1 and settles them in phase 3 with the handler invocation in between. A crash anywhere between claim and settle leaves a row in `(claimed_at IS NOT NULL, completed_at IS NULL)` — *in-flight* state. Without recovery, that row is stuck forever: the partial index `WHERE claimed_at IS NULL` skips it, so neither the next dispatcher tick nor a process restart will pick it up.

The crash semantics noted in `application/use_cases/sweeper_action_dispatcher.py` document this as a known limitation. v1 handlers (`NotifyAdminsHandler`, `DiscardSilentlyHandler`) are log-only and idempotent, so re-running them is benign — but the invariant only holds because we don't re-run them today. Future handlers (the deferred `SEND_PARTIAL_FLAGGED` and `NOTIFY_SUBSCRIBERS`) will issue real side effects and require a deliberate retry policy.

**Work**

- Add a "stale claim" threshold to `SweeperActionRepository`: a row is reclaimable if `completed_at IS NULL AND claimed_at < now - stale_threshold`. Configurable via `config.sweeper.stale_claim_threshold_seconds` (default 300).
- New repo method `reclaim_stuck(now, stale_threshold, limit)` — sets `claimed_at = now` on stuck rows and returns them as `ClaimedAction` (with `attempts` carrying the previous attempt count). Either folds into `claim_pending` (one query that picks up both pending and stale-in-flight) or runs as a separate phase. Folding keeps the contract simpler.
- Adjust `claim_pending` SQL accordingly. The existing partial index `idx_sweeper_actions_pending` no longer covers all claimable rows; either widen it (`WHERE completed_at IS NULL`) or add a sister index for the stuck-claim path.
- Bound retries: when `attempts >= max_attempts`, stop reclaiming the row and emit a `dispatcher_action_abandoned` log + audit event so operators know.
- Tests: a row whose `claimed_at` is older than the threshold gets reclaimed; the `attempts` counter is preserved across reclaims; rows under the threshold are not touched; rows past `max_attempts` stop reclaiming.

**Why deferred from 14b.3**

14b.3 was already large (port surface + adapter + use case + 20 tests). Stuck-claim recovery is a self-contained follow-up that doesn't change the L2-SWEEP-006 contract — it strengthens the at-least-once guarantee on the dispatch side. Better to land it as its own focused increment than bundle it into 14b.

**Trace impact when complete**

No new L1/L2/L3 statements yet — this is a quality refinement under the existing L2-SWEEP-006 / L3-SWEEP-013 umbrella. Consider whether to author an L3 statement pinning the stale-claim semantics so the contract is reviewable.

### Increment 14e — Wire `max_candidates_per_iteration` + L2-SWEEP-005 tests  *(✅ done — commit `fb54f98`)*

**Problem (correctness, not just traceability)**

`L3-SWEEP-008` (`docs/L3-REQ.md:428`) requires `sweeper.max_candidates_per_iteration` with default 1000 and a `LIMIT` clause on `list_expired`. Today:

- `SweeperConfig` (`src/message_service/config/schema.py:179`) has no such field.
- `_SQL_LIST_EXPIRED_BASE` (`src/message_service/infrastructure/persistence/run_repository.py:105`) has no `LIMIT` clause.

A large backlog (e.g., post-incident recovery against tens of thousands of stuck runs) is processed in one tick, holding the connection across thousands of per-run UoWs and starving everything else on the shared SQLite connection until the tick completes. This is an availability bug, not just a missing test.

The L2 parent (`L2-SWEEP-005`) is still rolled up as **Draft** in the trace matrix because both its L3 children (`L3-SWEEP-007` query shape and `L3-SWEEP-008` LIMIT) lack direct tests.

**Work**

1. Add `max_candidates_per_iteration: int = Field(default=1000, ge=1)` to `SweeperConfig`. Update `config.toml.example` + `default.toml`.
2. Plumb it through `SweeperUseCase` and into `RunRepository.list_expired(..., limit: int)`. Append `LIMIT ?` to `_SQL_LIST_EXPIRED_BASE`.
3. Tests under `tests/unit/infrastructure/persistence/test_run_repository.py`:
   - SQL shape: assert the `state IN (...)` clause holds exactly `INITIATED, AGGREGATING, READY, SENDING` — verify by mixed-state seed data and result inspection (per L3-SWEEP-007).
   - LIMIT honored: seed N+1 expired runs, call `list_expired(limit=N)`, assert the result has exactly N entries (per L3-SWEEP-008).
4. Test under `tests/unit/application/use_cases/test_sweeper.py`: a tick over a backlog larger than `max_candidates_per_iteration` SHALL drain in multiple ticks, not one.
5. **Promote the field upward** (team-flagged): `max_candidates_per_iteration` is currently invented at L3 only. Add it to the L1-CFG-003 enumerated minimum config keys, and add an L2-SWEEP statement under L1-SWEEP-001 covering "the sweeper SHALL bound per-tick work via a configurable max-candidates limit." Otherwise the L3 statement has no parent rationale at L1 or L2 and the config schema looks like an unjustified extra.

**Trace impact**: L3-SWEEP-007 + L3-SWEEP-008 Draft → Implemented; L2-SWEEP-005 rolls up to Implemented; L1-SWEEP-002 rollup becomes consistent (see 14g for the broader rollup fix); L1-CFG-003 enumeration grows by one entry.

### Increment 14f — Sweeper boundary alignment: L1↔L3↔SQL all inclusive  *(✅ done — commit `1cdfc3d`)*

**Problem**

The boundary semantics are *inconsistent across all three requirement layers and the SQL*:

- `L1-SWEEP-002` (`docs/L1-REQ.md:365`) says elapsed time must "**exceed**" the timeout — strict `>`.
- `L3-SWEEP-017` (`docs/L3-REQ.md:455`) says a run "**exactly** `run_timeout_seconds` ago" SHALL be classified as orphaned — inclusive `>=`.
- `_SQL_LIST_EXPIRED_BASE` (`src/message_service/infrastructure/persistence/run_repository.py:112`) uses `WHERE updated_at < ?` — strict `<` (matches L1, contradicts L3).

Pick one convention and propagate it through every layer. Recommendation: **inclusive (`>=` / `<=`)** since L3-SWEEP-017's prose is more specific than L1-SWEEP-002's "exceed" and aligns better with operator intent ("a run that's been silent for the full timeout has earned the orphan label, no extra grace period").

**Work**

1. Update `L1-SWEEP-002` wording: "exceeds" → "meets or exceeds" (or rephrase: "when the elapsed time since its last state transition is greater than or equal to the configured run-timeout"). Update Rationale to mention the inclusive boundary.
2. Confirm `L3-SWEEP-017` is unchanged — it already specifies inclusive.
3. Change `_SQL_LIST_EXPIRED_BASE`: `updated_at < ?` → `updated_at <= ?`.
4. Add the L3-SWEEP-017 boundary test under `tests/unit/infrastructure/persistence/test_run_repository.py`: seed a run with `updated_at` exactly equal to the cutoff; confirm `list_expired(cutoff=...)` returns it.
5. Mirror the test at the use-case level under `tests/unit/application/use_cases/test_sweeper.py`: tick a sweeper at `clock.now() == run.updated_at + run_timeout`; assert `result.orphaned_count == 1`.

**Trace impact**: L3-SWEEP-017 Draft → Implemented; L1-SWEEP-002 wording aligned; helps promote L2-SWEEP-002 (along with L3-SWEEP-003).

**Sequencing**: small SQL change + L1 wording fix + two new tests. Land as a single commit.

### Increment 14g — Trace-matrix rollup correctness  *(superseded by 25a `1f26f2f`)*

**Problem**

`docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md:164-165` shows L1-SWEEP-001 and L1-SWEEP-002 marked **Implemented** while three of their L2 children (L2-SWEEP-001, L2-SWEEP-002, L2-SWEEP-005) are **Draft**. The L1 status is computed independently of child status, so an L1 can claim Implemented despite gaps below it. That makes the matrix unreliable as a release-readiness signal — an Implemented L1 should mean every child is at least Implemented, otherwise the rollup misleads operators and reviewers.

**Work**

1. In `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py`, change the L1 rollup so an L1 is Implemented only if every L2 child is Implemented (or higher). Otherwise it's Draft. Same rule applied to the eventual Verified state once that's wired.
2. Apply the same propagation rule top-to-bottom on regen: L2 → L3 children.
3. Add a status legend update in `TRACE-MATRIX.md`'s preamble explaining the rollup rule so operators reading the matrix understand "Implemented at L1 means every child has at least one verification artifact."
4. Add a unit test under `tests/conformance/` (or under `scripts/`-adjacent tests if any exist) that builds a synthetic L1/L2/L3 graph with a Draft leaf and asserts the L1 root rolls up as Draft, not Implemented.

**Trace impact**: matrix becomes trustworthy. L1-SWEEP-001 / L1-SWEEP-002 / L1-SWEEP-003 will likely flip to Draft until 14e + 14f + a future increment cover the L2-SWEEP-001 / L2-SWEEP-002 children that don't yet have artifacts. That's the *correct* state — the matrix should make the gap visible, not hide it.

**Sequencing**: best to land 14g *after* 14e and 14f so the post-rollup state isn't a confusing flood of regressions in one PR.

### Increment 14h — Implement the unit-test I/O guard  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

**Problem**

`tests/unit/conftest.py:1-19` documents an I/O guard that "monkey-patches ``socket.socket`` and ``aiosqlite.connect`` to raise ``RuntimeError`` during unit-test collection." The fixture body (`tests/unit/conftest.py:40-48`) is just `yield`. The TODO at line 47 even admits it's deferred. The unit/integration boundary is currently aspirational, not enforced — a "unit" test that opens a SQLite database or a socket would silently pass.

**Work**

1. Implement the guard in a new `tests/fixtures/io_guard.py`. Patch `socket.socket.__init__` and `aiosqlite.connect` to raise `RuntimeError("unit tests forbid I/O — see tests/README.md")`.
2. Wire it into `tests/unit/conftest.py::_forbid_io` so the fixture actually applies the patches (and reverts on teardown).
3. The unit tests under `tests/unit/infrastructure/persistence/` legitimately use SQLite (against `:memory:`). Either:
   - Move them into `tests/integration/persistence/` where they belong (cleanest, but a bigger move).
   - Add a per-file opt-out marker (`@pytest.mark.allow_io` or similar) and have the guard skip patched modules in those files.

   Recommendation: option 1 — they ARE integration tests by definition (multiple components against real local resources, per `tests/README.md`). The current location is convenient but mislabeled.
4. Conformance test that the guard fires: a deliberately-violating unit test that tries to open `aiosqlite.connect(":memory:")` SHALL raise.

**Sequencing**: the fixture-implementation half is small; the test-relocation half is the bulk of the work. Could split into 14h.1 (implement guard, file the relocation as a follow-up) and 14h.2 (relocate). Either way doesn't block other work.

---

## Cluster 25 — Requirements specification cleanup

Born from two reviews (mine + the team's) of L1/L2/L3 source docs vs. the implemented code and the trace matrix. These are mostly docs-only edits, but several cross over into small code changes (added L1/L2 statements, added or reworded L3 statements, audit-log docstring fix). They should land **before** Cluster 15+ feature work — every new feature increment otherwise compounds the spec drift.

### Increment 25a — Source-of-truth for status + artifacts  *(✅ done — commit `1f26f2f`)*

Per team recommendation: **remove `Status` and `Verification Artifact` fields from L1/L2/L3 source docs entirely**, keep them only in `TRACE-MATRIX.md`, and make `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py` the sole authority. This is cleaner than auto-syncing two sources, which would forever risk drift between commits.

**Problem**

- All 57 L1, 157 L2, 315 L3 statements still carry `Status: Draft` and `Verification Artifact: (TBD)` in the source docs while `TRACE-MATRIX.md` is the live source. Two stores, drifting on every commit.
- Trace-matrix `Implemented` is too loose: it fires when *any* test marker exists, including for an L1 whose L2 children are all Draft. (Same root issue as Increment 14g, framed at the model level.)
- No `Partially Implemented` state, so a parent with some-but-not-all children done has nowhere accurate to land.

**Work**

1. Add a fourth status value — **`Partially Implemented`** — to the legend in `TRACE-MATRIX.md` and to the conventions section of L1-REQ.md.
2. **Rollup rule** (supersedes Increment 14g; merge them). Computed L1↔L2↔L3 by the script:
   - Every child `Implemented` (or higher) → parent `Implemented`.
   - At least one child `Implemented` and at least one `Draft` → parent `Partially Implemented`.
   - Every child `Draft` → parent `Draft`.
3. **Drop `Status:` and `Verification Artifact:` lines** from L1-REQ.md, L2-REQ.md, L3-REQ.md entirely. Add a note at the top of each: *"Status and verification artifacts are tracked in `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`; consult it for the live state of every requirement."*
4. `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py` becomes the single source of truth: reads `@pytest.mark.requirement` markers, computes leaf-level status, propagates upward, writes the matrix. The L1/L2/L3 docs become pure spec content (Statement, Rationale, Verification Method, Parent links).
5. Conformance test that the rollup propagation works (covers Increment 14g's test 4 — fold them).
6. The CI gate from Increment 26c will then enforce: build fails if the script's regenerated matrix differs from the committed one OR if any rollup is internally inconsistent.

**Sequencing**: largely supersedes Increment 14g; merge them. **Land 25a first** in Cluster 25 — it's the team's recommended step 1 and the foundation everything else's trace-matrix work depends on.

### Increment 25b — L1 contradictions and v1/v2 boundaries  *(✅ done — commit `eb5f537`)*

Per team recommended step 2. Four L1 fixes that resolve direct spec-vs-spec or spec-vs-implementation contradictions.

1. **L1-AGGR-001 vs L1-STAGE-003 contradiction.** AGGR-001 says report contribution is "required" per `SubmitStageReport`; STAGE-003 says a stage may submit no report and no email body content; L2-STAGE-006 confirms STAGE-003. Reword AGGR-001's "required" → "optional" (or "two content slots, both of which may be empty"), consistent with STAGE-003.
2. **L1-OBS-003 audit scope is too narrow.** It limits the audit log to "successful email deliveries… and failed delivery attempts." The implemented `AuditAction` enum has 14 categories (`BEGIN_RUN`, `SUBMIT_STAGE_REPORT`, `FINALIZE_RUN`, `RUN_STATE_TRANSITION`, `STAGE_STATE_TRANSITION`, `SWEEP_ORPHAN`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE`, `CREATE_USER`, `UPDATE_USER`, `LOGIN`, `LOGIN_FAILED`, `LOGOUT`, `SEND_REPORT`). Widen L1-OBS-003 to cover the real scope; add L2 derivations under it for the run-lifecycle, stage-lifecycle, sweeper, subscription, and auth audit categories.
3. **L1-STAGE-001 IN_PROGRESS v1/v2 boundary.** L1 lists `IN_PROGRESS` as a regular state; the SQL `CHECK` constraint rejects it; the transition table forbids it; code comments mark it "reserved for v2." Mark `IN_PROGRESS` as explicitly reserved in L1-STAGE-001's Statement and Rationale so the L1 reads accurately. (L2-STAGE-002 already pins this — propagate the reserved framing up to L1.)
4. **L1-SWEEP-003 deferred actions.** L1-SWEEP-003 lists all four disposition actions as if all worked. After Increment 14a, only `DISCARD_SILENTLY` and `NOTIFY_ADMINS` are registered; configs that reference the others raise `ConfigurationError` at startup. Two sub-options:
   - **(a)** Annotate L1-SWEEP-003: "v1 implements `DISCARD_SILENTLY` and `NOTIFY_ADMINS`; the other two action ids remain valid in the type but raise `ConfigurationError` at startup until implemented (see ROADMAP)."
   - **(b)** Remove `SEND_PARTIAL_FLAGGED` and `NOTIFY_SUBSCRIBERS` from L1-SWEEP-003 entirely and move them to ROADMAP Part 2.

   Recommendation: **(a)** — keeps the type stable and makes the v1 implementation boundary explicit. Pair with the new L3 in 25c step 3 (known-but-unregistered → `ConfigurationError`).

### Increment 25c — Cross-layer drift fixes  *(✅ done — commit `c5b9854`)*

Per team recommended step 3. Three drift fixes between requirement statements and the code/L2 reality they describe.

1. **Audit-log port docstring misreferences.** `src/message_service/application/ports/audit_log.py`'s docstring cites `L2-OBS-002, L2-OBS-005` as the audit-contract requirements. Both are wrong: L2-OBS-002 is about contextvars-based logging-context propagation; L2-OBS-005 is about Prometheus metric naming. After 25b widens L1-OBS-003 and adds new L2 audit derivations, point the docstring at the correct L2 numbers. Then `grep -r "Requirement references"` for similar drift across other ports and use cases.
2. **L2-STAGE-007 stage-orphan wording vs. implementation.** L2-STAGE-007 says the sweeper "SHALL classify any stage in state PENDING at orphan-timeout evaluation as missing." The current sweeper queries `runs` only — never `stages`. The L2 promises a code path that doesn't exist. Two sub-options:
   - **(a) Reword** L2-STAGE-007 to match emergent behavior: "Any run containing PENDING stages at orphan-timeout SHALL be treated according to L1-SWEEP-002's run-level orphan rule."
   - **(b) Implement** stage-level orphan classification: add L3 statements under L2-SWEEP for "the sweeper SHALL record the list of PENDING stage_ids in the SWEEP_ORPHAN audit details," extend `SqliteRunRepository.list_expired` to surface them, extend the audit details payload accordingly.

   Recommendation: **(b)** per team framing — operator value of "which stages were missing when this orphaned" is real for incident investigation. (a) is the doc-only escape hatch if (b) feels too big.
3. **Sweeper action availability — new L3.** Pair with 25b.4: add an explicit L3 under L2-SWEEP-007 (or L2-SWEEP-008): *"Known disposition action identifiers in `DispositionAction` whose handlers are not registered SHALL raise `ConfigurationError` at startup with `details.unregistered_actions` listing the offenders."* This pins the runtime behavior Increment 14a already delivers and closes the spec gap the team flagged.

### Increment 25d — Net-new requirements: report retention, clock validity, rate limiting  *(✅ done — commit `3f45426`)*

Per team recommended step 4. Real gaps in the spine where the implementation either silently assumes or grows unbounded. **Two earlier proposed items dropped after team verification:**

- ~~Graceful shutdown~~ — *already covered by L2-DEP-006 + L3-DEP-010/-011/-012*. The L1 anchor (L1-DEP-002) could be made more explicit, but that's a minor wording polish, not a missing-requirement gap. Optional sub-task: add one sentence to L1-DEP-002 noting graceful shutdown is part of the start/stop/restart lifecycle.
- ~~Mail backoff formula~~ — *already pinned at L2-MAIL-006 and L3-MAIL-009*. No work needed.

Remaining real gaps:

1. **Rendered-report retention.** L1-OBS-003 has retention for the audit log; rendered HTML reports on disk grow forever. Add a new L1 (proposed **L1-PERS-004**): *"Rendered reports SHALL be retained on disk for at least `persistence.filesystem.report_retention_days` (default value TBD by ops); a background pruner SHALL evict reports older than the retention window."* L2/L3 derivations cover the pruner schedule, atomic delete semantics, and audit-log entry on each prune. A future implementation increment then writes the pruner.
2. **Clock validity assumption.** Every timestamp trusts the host clock; sweeper thresholds, SLA windows, audit ordering all depend on it. Add new L1 anchor (proposed **L1-DEP-004** if reusing the DEP category) or an L2 under L1-RUN-005: *"The service SHALL assume the host clock is synchronized to UTC within ±N seconds and is monotonically non-decreasing under normal operation; behavior under backward host-clock corrections greater than N seconds is unspecified."* Pair with a Rationale that points at the `Clock` port as the encapsulation boundary.
3. **Rate limiting decision.** No L1 covers per-pipeline concurrency caps or in-flight RPC limits. Two sub-options:
   - **(a)** Author L1-API-005: *"The service SHALL bound concurrent in-flight RPCs by a configurable global limit; excess SHALL be rejected with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and an error code identifying the saturation cause."*
   - **(b)** Document in ROADMAP Part 2 that v1 deliberately omits rate limiting because the trusted-ISOLAN deployment model assumes well-behaved clients; promote when a non-trusted ingress emerges.

   Recommendation: **(b)** for v1 — the trusted-ISOLAN context is a real constraint that justifies the omission and matches how L1-API-003 frames plaintext gRPC.

### Increment 25e — Smaller spec cleanup  *(✅ done — commit `d67539a`)*

Lower-impact catch-all so these don't get lost. Both team-corrected items removed.

1. **L2-AGGR-009 duplication note.** L2-AGGR-009's Rationale already says "this duplicates the statement here to anchor it under the AGGR category." Convert from a re-statement of L2-RUN-011 to an explicit "see L2-RUN-011" cross-reference so readers don't have to spot the dupe.
2. **Merge "L3-OBS (extension)"** section into L3-OBS proper. Remove the workaround note ("they are grouped separately… for clarity").
3. **L1-CFG-003 enumeration completeness** (folds the team's #C and my finding). Add to the L1-CFG-003 minimum config keys: `email_body_template_ref`, `pipelines.registered`, `mail.admin_recipients`, `templates.max_context_bytes`/`max_rendered_bytes`, `smtp.use_starttls`, `persistence.connection_pool_size`. (`max_candidates_per_iteration` lands via 14e; `service.shutdown_grace_period_seconds` is already implicit through L2-DEP-006.)

### Increment 25f — Audit-record L3 children for L2-OBS-013…017

**Context**

The 2026-04-25 requirements alignment audit (commit `0e07138`) found that five L2 statements under L1-OBS-003 (the audit-log scope L2s authored in 25b) had no L3 children: L2-OBS-013 (pipeline-initiated audits), L2-OBS-014 (state transitions), L2-OBS-015 (sweeper), L2-OBS-016 (subscriptions), L2-OBS-017 (auth and user management). The L2 statements claim audit-record format obligations (actor / resource / outcome / details for each `AuditAction` category) but have no implementation-level decomposition pinning the exact field formats.

**Work**

Author 12 new L3-OBS statements (`L3-OBS-025`…`L3-OBS-036`) covering each `AuditAction` value referenced by the five L2s:

- L3-OBS-025…027: `BEGIN_RUN`, `SUBMIT_STAGE_REPORT`, `FINALIZE_RUN` formats (L2-OBS-013).
- L3-OBS-028, 029: `RUN_STATE_TRANSITION`, `STAGE_STATE_TRANSITION` formats (L2-OBS-014). `STAGE_STATE_TRANSITION` is forward-spec — the enum value exists but no use case currently emits it.
- L3-OBS-030: `SWEEP_ORPHAN` format (L2-OBS-015).
- L3-OBS-031, 032: `SUBSCRIBE`, `UNSUBSCRIBE` formats (L2-OBS-016) — implementation deferred to Increment 18.
- L3-OBS-033: `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT` format (L2-OBS-017).
- L3-OBS-034: `LOGIN_FAILED` format with operator-only `reason` (L2-OBS-017).
- L3-OBS-035: `CREATE_USER`, `UPDATE_USER` format (L2-OBS-017) — implementation deferred to Increment 20.
- L3-OBS-036: cross-cutting password / token redaction obligation (L2-OBS-017).

Markers added to existing tests for the implemented cases. Forward-spec L3s (029, 031, 032, 035) carry no markers and will appear as Draft in the trace matrix; that's the correct state.

**Trace impact**

L2-OBS-013, L2-OBS-015 and L2-OBS-017 now have direct L3 children covering their core obligations. L2-OBS-014 and L2-OBS-016 are partially covered (the not-yet-implemented record types remain Draft). L3 total: 335 → 347.

## Cluster 26 — CI/CD requirements + workflows

The team flagged "Full requirements for CICD" as missing, which is true — there's no L1-CICD category, no L2/L3 derivations, and `.github/workflows/` is empty. This cluster authors the requirements then implements them.

### Increment 26a — Author L1-CICD requirements category  *(✅ done — commit `220c1d5`)*

Net-new category in `docs/L1-REQ.md`. Proposed L1 statements (final wording subject to spec review):

- **L1-CICD-001 — Cross-platform pytest matrix.** "The service's full pytest suite SHALL pass on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` GitHub Actions runners on every push to `main` and on every pull request, with no `ResourceWarning` for unclosed sockets, file handles, or event loops."
- **L1-CICD-002 — Pre-commit gate.** "All pre-commit hooks (ruff format, ruff check, mypy strict, the standard whitespace/yaml/toml hygiene set) SHALL pass on CI on every push and pull request, with the same pinned hook versions as local development."
- **L1-CICD-003 — Coverage gate.** "Branch coverage on `src/message_service/` SHALL meet the threshold pinned in `pyproject.toml` (`--cov-fail-under`); CI SHALL fail if it drops."
- **L1-CICD-004 — Traceability gate.** "CI SHALL fail if any L1 row is `Implemented` while any of its L2/L3 descendants are `Draft` (per the propagation rule from 25a). The build SHALL fail with a list of inconsistent rows."
- **L1-CICD-005 — Test-temp isolation.** "Pytest temporary files SHALL be rooted in workspace-local `.pytest_tmp/` (already enforced via `--basetemp` in `pyproject.toml`); the directory SHALL be `.gitignore`d so test artifacts never enter source control."
- **L1-CICD-006 — Reproducibility.** "The Poetry lockfile (`poetry.lock`) SHALL be committed and SHALL produce identical dependency resolutions across runs; CI SHALL fail if `poetry lock --check` reports drift."
- **L1-CICD-007 — Build provenance.** "The CI workflow SHALL record the commit SHA, the Python version, the OS, and the timestamp of every test run as part of the workflow output, available for download as artifacts."

L2 derivations: workflow filename conventions, matrix entry shape, `ResourceWarning` filter configuration, allowed CI duration ceiling, scheduled re-runs on `main`, etc.

L3 derivations: specific YAML, the exact pytest invocation per OS (Windows path quoting!), the coverage XML upload path, etc.

### Increment 26b — CI/CD workflow implementation  *(✅ done — commit `c22ebc9`)*

Cash in the L1-CICD requirements as `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`. Matrix (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`) × (Python `3.12`, `3.13`). Per-job: `poetry install`, `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`, `poetry run pytest`, `poetry run python scripts/build-trace-matrix.py --check` (new flag — exit non-zero if regenerated matrix differs from committed). Upload `coverage.xml` and `.coverage_html/` as artifacts. Schedule a nightly run on `main` to catch flakes that pass per-PR.

### Increment 26c — Traceability rollup CI gate  *(✅ done — commit `f99f795`)*

Implements **L1-CICD-004** specifically. `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py` gains a `--check` mode that re-derives the matrix in memory, compares against the committed `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`, and exits non-zero if they differ OR if any row violates the parent-status-bounded-by-children rule from 25a. Wired into the CI workflow from 26b.

### Increment 26d — Cross-platform pytest hygiene audit  *(✅ done — commit `aa6550c`)*

Implements **L1-CICD-001 / L1-CICD-005** specifically. Audit `pyproject.toml`'s `filterwarnings` (currently has `"error"` plus a Google-deprecation ignore) for completeness. Verify `.gitignore` includes `.pytest_tmp/` (likely already does — confirm). Run the suite on Windows with `-W error::ResourceWarning -W error::DeprecationWarning` and fix anything that surfaces. The recent Windows-event-loop work (`tests/conftest.py::_NoImplicitEventLoopPolicy`) suggests this surface is already partly clean, but a deliberate pass is worthwhile.

---

### Increment 15 — Prometheus metrics adapter  *(✅ done — commit `fe5c3a4`)*

Closes **L1-OBS-002, L1-OBS-003** (currently Draft).

- Add `infrastructure/observability/metrics.py` with the counters/histograms named in L2-OBS-004…009 (run-state transitions, stage-submit latency, email size, sweeper rounds).
- Inject through a thin port so domain/application stay framework-free.
- Lifts `error_mapping.py` and `logging_setup.py` out of the 0%-covered gap noted in this file's Part 2.

### Increment 16 — Local-account auth adapter  *(✅ done — commit `7ede66c`)*

Closes **L1-AUTH-001, L1-AUTH-002** (Draft). `rest/auth/` is currently empty.

- `argon2-cffi` `PasswordHasher` adapter (`infrastructure/auth/argon2_hasher.py`),
  service-scoped singleton wired by `bootstrap.build_service`.
- `Password`, `User`, `Session` aggregates; `UserRepository`, `SessionRepository`,
  `PasswordHasher` ports.
- SQLite adapters + migration `003_auth_schema.sql` (adds `users.password_hash` +
  `users.is_admin`, creates `sessions`).
- `LoginUseCase` (mints `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, persists SHA-256, audits
  `LOGIN`/`LOGIN_FAILED` with operator-only `reason` per L3-AUTH-013) and
  `LogoutUseCase` (idempotent delete by token-hash, audits `LOGOUT`).
- Session-cookie + CSRF middleware deferred to Increment 17 with the FastAPI
  chassis. Admin user creation deferred to Increment 20 (admin surfaces).

### Increment 17 — FastAPI app factory + bootstrap wiring  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

`rest/routes/` is empty; `__main__.py` only spins up the gRPC server.

- `interfaces/rest/app.py` builds the FastAPI instance from `Service`.
- `__main__.py` runs uvicorn alongside `grpc.aio` under one shutdown event.
- No domain routes yet — chassis + login flow only.

### Increment 18 — Subscription management routes  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

Closes **L1-DASH-001, L1-SUB-002** (Draft).

- CRUD over `SqliteSubscriptionRepository` for the existing GLOBAL/PIPELINE/TAG granularity.
- Jinja screens under `rest/html/templates/`.

### Increment 19 — Past-runs / resend / report viewer

The original ROADMAP entry combined paginated runs list, resend, and rendered-report viewer into one increment. Survey before kickoff revealed the filesystem report store is **completely unimplemented** (no port, no adapter, no write path in `AssembleAndDeliverUseCase`); spec only goes as far as L2-PERS-005/006 on atomic-rename + directory creation. Bundling the store implementation alongside two REST features inflates 19 into ~1000 LOC of mixed concerns.

Split into three sub-increments. New L2/L3 statements authored upfront (this commit): L2-DASH-012/013/014, L3-DASH-022..030 (with L3-DASH-013 reworded), L3-PERS-024..026.

#### Increment 19a — Past-runs paginated list + run-detail metadata view  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

**Closes**: the "list / view metadata" portion of `L1-DASH-003`.

**Work**

- Add `RunRepository.list_paginated(*, limit, offset, states)` to the run-repo port and SQLite adapter (per `L3-DASH-024`'s ORDER BY + LIMIT/OFFSET shape).
- Add `ListPastRunsUseCase` and `GetRunDetailUseCase` (thin wrappers — most logic lives at the route + repo level).
- Routes under `interfaces/rest/routes/runs.py`:
  - `GET /runs` — paginated list with `limit`/`offset`/`states` query params per `L3-DASH-022/023/024`.
  - `GET /runs/{run_id}` — run detail per `L3-DASH-025/026`.
- Wire into `create_app` via `include_router` (mirrors the 18 subscription router pattern).
- Tests: integration tests for pagination semantics, default-states filter, ordering, run-not-found 404, malformed UUID 422.

**Verification**

- L3-DASH-022..026 promote from Draft → Implemented.
- L1-DASH-003 partial roll-up; remaining clauses ("view rendered reports", "trigger manual resends") covered by 19c and 19b respectively.

#### Increment 19b — Manual resend (re-renders from saved Stage context)  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

**Closes**: the "trigger manual resends to the current active subscriber list" portion of `L1-DASH-003`.

**Work**

- Add `AuditAction.RESEND_REPORT` to the `domain/aggregates/audit_event.py` enum. The audit-format L3 (L3-DASH-013) was reworded from `outcome=RESEND` to `action=RESEND_REPORT, outcome=SUCCESS/FAILURE` — the new enum value is the implementation hook.
- Add `ResendRunUseCase` that:
  - Looks up the run; reject with 409 if state ∉ `{SENT, FAILED}` per `L3-DASH-028`.
  - Re-resolves recipients via `SubscriptionRepository.list_recipients_for_run` (per `L3-DASH-012`).
  - Re-renders by replaying `AssembleAndDeliverUseCase` against the persisted `Stage.report_context_json` (per `L3-DASH-027`) — explicitly NOT reading the filesystem report store snapshot, so resend works even before 19c lands.
  - Re-delivers via `Mailer.send`; emits `AuditAction.RESEND_REPORT` audit per `L3-DASH-013`.
- Route: `POST /runs/{run_id}/resend` (CSRF-guarded by the existing middleware; the run-state-precondition check returns 409).
- Tests: integration tests covering happy path, 409-on-non-terminal, 409-on-orphaned, recipient-resolution-at-resend-time (the `L3-DASH-012` "new subscription added between send and resend gets the resent email" case), audit format matches `L3-DASH-013`.

**Verification**

- L3-DASH-012/013/027/028 promote from Draft → Implemented.
- L2-DASH-008 promotes from Draft → Implemented.

#### Increment 19c — Filesystem report store + report viewer  *(✅ done; see commit log)*

**Closes**: the "view past rendered reports" portion of `L1-DASH-003` and gives `L1-PERS-002` a concrete repository under it.

**Work**

- New port `application/ports/report_store.py` per `L3-PERS-024`.
- New adapter `infrastructure/persistence/filesystem/report_store.py` per `L3-PERS-025/026`. Atomic-write via `<final>.tmp` + `Path.replace()` per the existing `L2-PERS-005`.
- Wire `AssembleAndDeliverUseCase` to call `ReportStore.save_email_body(...)` after successful delivery and `ReportStore.save_fragment(...)` for each rendered fragment during render.
- Bootstrap: construct the report-store directory at startup per `L2-PERS-006`; expose the report-store on the `Service` dataclass.
- Routes: `GET /runs/{run_id}/report` and `GET /runs/{run_id}/stages/{stage_id}/fragment` per `L3-DASH-029/030`.
- Tests: integration tests for atomic-write semantics, directory layout, the 404-when-pre-existing case, and the route-level happy paths.

**Verification**

- L3-PERS-024/025/026 promote from Draft → Implemented.
- L2-DASH-014 + L3-DASH-029/030 promote from Draft → Implemented.
- L1-DASH-003 fully closed (all three clauses now have implementation + tests).

### Increment 20 — Admin surfaces

Closes **L1-DASH-004** (Draft).

- User management, audit-log viewer, template inspection — all read-mostly over existing adapters.
- Gate behind an `is_admin` flag on `User`.

### Increment 21 — E2E happy-path + orphan-path harness

`tests/e2e/{happy_path,admin,orphan_path,resend}/` currently contain only `__init__.py`.

- Stand up the `running_service` fixture sketched in `tests/README.md` (real `grpc.aio` + httpx + tmp SQLite + `aiosmtpd`).
- BeginRun → submissions → FinalizeRun → email path.
- Sweeper-fires-and-disposes path.
- Moves a wave of L2 rows from "Implemented" to "Verified".

### Increment 22 — Error-mapping + servicer tests, exception-detail coverage

Closes **L1-ERR-001..004** (all Draft).

- Unit tests for `interfaces/grpc/error_mapping.py` (translation table, trailing-metadata population).
- `details=` assertions across the use-case raise sites.

### Increment 23 — Deployment polish

Closes **L1-DEP-001, L1-DEP-003** (Draft). The `deploy/` placeholders need to be finished.

- systemd unit env-var passthrough.
- NSSM Windows install script.
- Graceful-shutdown verification artifact tied to existing `__main__.py` signal handling.
- A minimal `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` — the directory exists but is empty.

### Increment 24 — Documentation deliverables (release-gating)

- Promote `tests/README.md` into the formal **Test strategy document** listed in Part 2.
- First two ADRs into `docs/adr/`: SQLite-for-in-flight-state, hexagonal boundary enforcement.
- **Operator runbook** + **Pipeline integration guide** drafts.
- All four are explicit Part 2 items; tagging v1 should retire them.

### Cross-cutting tradeoffs (refreshed 2026-04-25)

The historical sequencing block has been pruned now that Clusters 14 (excluding 14h), 25, and 26, plus Increments 15 and 16, are merged. What remains:

**Feature stream (Increments 19a–22)**

- **19a → 19b → 19c → 20** complete the dashboard, building on the chassis 17 delivered and the subscription CRUD 18 added. 19a delivers the past-runs paginated list + run-detail view (read-only metadata); 19b adds manual resend (re-renders from saved Stage context, no filesystem-store dependency); 19c lands the filesystem report store + the rendered-report viewer routes. The split was driven by the survey before kickoff — the filesystem store is its own substantive subsystem and benefits from a focused increment.
- **21** (E2E harness) can shift earlier — slotting it in after one or two more domain-router increments forces the FastAPI chassis to stay testable as routes accrete.
- **22** (error-mapping + servicer tests) is independent of the dashboard stream and can interleave whenever convenient.

**Recommended next-up sequencing**

1. **20** — admin surfaces. (19a/19b/19c landed; L1-DASH-003 fully closed.)
2. **21** — E2E happy-path + orphan-path harness.
3. **22** — error-mapping + servicer tests; independent stream.
4. **23, 24** — deployment polish + documentation deliverables (release-gating).

---

## Part 2 — Deferred from v1

## Testing and verification

- **Test strategy document** — a top-level document covering unit test conventions, integration test harness for gRPC and FastAPI, end-to-end run-simulation fixtures, orphan-path test harness, and SMTP sandbox configuration. (Partially superseded by `tests/README.md`; still to be promoted to a formal top-level doc.)
- ~~**pytest marker auto-extraction tool**~~ — **Done.** `scripts/build-trace-matrix.py` now scans `@pytest.mark.requirement` markers and auto-populates `docs/TRACE-MATRIX.md`.
- ~~**Coverage ratchet**~~ — **Done.** Gate is at `--cov-fail-under=85` in `pyproject.toml`; the historical 60% → 75% → 85% ratchet has completed.
- **Coverage enforcement** — CI gate requiring every approved L1 requirement to have at least one linked verification artifact before release. (The `--cov-fail-under` gate enforces aggregate coverage; requirement-level coverage tracking is the separate item.)

## Performance and profiling

- **In-flight run state backing profiling** — v1 co-locates in-flight run state in SQLite, relying on SQLite's built-in WAL journal for durability. If profiling later shows SQLite write latency is a bottleneck on the gRPC ingest hot path, evaluate an in-memory store with a custom write-ahead log. The repository-pattern abstraction (L1-PERS-003) makes this swap possible without touching domain code.
- **Email size distribution analysis** — once the Prometheus email-size histogram has collected production data, analyze for patterns that would justify per-pipeline-type size limits or automatic compression strategies.
- **R-DELIVER-001 — Outbox-backed background tasks** — `FinalizeRunUseCase` schedules the assembly workflow via `BackgroundTaskScheduler`, which is backed by `asyncio.create_task`. If the process dies after `FinalizeRun` commits but before the task completes, the delivery is lost (the run is stuck in `READY`/`SENDING`). Future option: outbox-row pattern. `FinalizeRun` writes a row to an `outbox` table inside the same transaction; a long-running worker drains the outbox and retries on failure. The existing `BackgroundTaskScheduler` port can be retained; its adapter simply reads from the outbox instead of accepting coroutines directly. Defer until multi-node deployment is in scope. Single-node ISOLAN deployments can survive the current risk because the orphan sweeper (L1-RUN-006) will eventually reclaim stuck runs, bounded by `sweeper.run_timeout_seconds`.
- **R-OBS-001 — Distributed tracing** — v1 has structured logging via structlog with `run_id` correlation; no trace spans. Future option: OpenTelemetry-based spans across the RPC handler, use case, UoW, and adapter calls. Useful primarily once the service is part of a larger distributed system; low value standalone.

## Security hardening

- **Mutual TLS on gRPC** — v1 uses plaintext TCP on the trusted ISOLAN network. Promote when gRPC ingest crosses trust boundaries or when compliance requirements demand transport encryption.
- **Additional authentication backends** — LDAP/AD and OIDC. Current scope is local accounts only. LDAP integration is the likely first addition, consistent with broader ISOLAN architecture patterns.
- **Secrets handling review** — SMTP credentials and any future API keys currently live in the TOML configuration file. Consider integration with Vault CE if secret rotation becomes operationally significant.
- **In-flight RPC concurrency limits / per-pipeline rate limiting** — v1 deliberately omits rate limiting because the trusted-ISOLAN deployment context assumes well-behaved pipeline clients (same rationale that justifies plaintext gRPC under L1-API-003). When the gRPC ingress crosses a trust boundary — concurrent with the mTLS item above — author **L1-API-005** ("the service SHALL bound concurrent in-flight RPCs by a configurable global limit; excess SHALL be rejected with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and an error code identifying the saturation cause") plus L2 derivations covering per-pipeline caps, per-RPC weight (BeginRun is cheap, FinalizeRun triggers assembly), and the rejection-error contract. Until then, a misbehaving pipeline can saturate the shared SQLite connection. Risk accepted in v1 scope.
- **Host-clock validity hardening** — L2-RUN-016 (added in Increment 25d) records v1's assumption that the host clock is monotonically non-decreasing UTC, with backward-correction handling explicitly out of scope. If deployment contexts emerge where backward NTP corrections are expected (VM pause/resume, virtualized environments with imprecise clocks), promote: dual-clock reconciliation (record both `time.monotonic()` and wall-clock per event; cross-check), warn-and-continue on detected backward jumps larger than a configurable threshold, and L3 statements pinning the detection mechanism. The single `Clock` port from L2-RUN-016 is the single chokepoint to make this swap.
- **R-DASH-001 — Role-based access control** — dashboard authentication (L1-AUTH-001) is baseline only; every authenticated user can perform every dashboard action. Future option: roles (viewer, operator, admin) with per-role action gates. Requires a `user_role` column and policy checks in dashboard use cases.
- **R-DASH-002 — Subscription identifier promotion to UUID4** — v1 mints subscription IDs as `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` (per L3-DASH-019, reconciled 2026-04-25 to match implementation). Per-user route scoping (L3-DASH-007) prevents cross-user access, but sequential integer IDs leak the system's subscription count to anyone who creates one. Promotion to UUID4 (server-generated `uuid.uuid4()`, stored as TEXT) defends against enumeration as a defense-in-depth measure. Requires: schema migration (new column type + backfill), `SubscriptionId` typedef change to `UUID`, repo + audit + route-validator updates, and an L3 reword back toward UUIDs. Likely paired with the mTLS / gRPC trust-boundary promotion above when the trust model widens beyond the ISOLAN deployment assumption.

## Feature extensions

- **Per-pipeline-type orphan policy override** — v1 applies a single global orphan disposition policy. Future work allows per-pipeline overrides of the policy set, with the global policy as fallback.
- **Hot-reload of tag vocabulary** — v1 loads the tag configuration at service start. Hot-reload removes the need for restart to add tags.
- **R-TMPL-002 — Hot-reload of templates** — the template manifest is loaded once at service start (L2-TMPL-001); changes require a restart. Future option: signal-driven reload (`SIGHUP`) that atomically swaps the manifest while in-flight runs continue to render against the old snapshot. Non-trivial: need a template-snapshot token carried through the assembly workflow so `BeginRun` and `FinalizeRun` of the same run see consistent template metadata.
- **R-TMPL-001 — Per-pipeline email body template** — the email body template is currently a single service-wide config value (`templates.email_body_template_ref`) used for every finalized run regardless of pipeline. Future option A — per-pipeline config: extend `[pipelines.registered.*]` entries with an optional `email_body_template_ref`; when present, overrides the service-wide default. Backwards-compatible: pipelines without an explicit value fall back to the default. Small schema change; no proto change; no new port. Future option B — per-run declaration: add an optional `email_body_template_ref` field to `BeginRunRequest`. More flexible but requires a proto change, a new field on the `Run` aggregate, additional validation at `BeginRun`, and a schema migration. Consider only if per-pipeline proves insufficient. Either path is additive and will not invalidate existing behavior.
- **R-AGGR-001 — Custom email body contributions from stages** — the email body template currently receives only stage identifiers (`stage_id`, `stage_order`, `had_content`) — not any stage-supplied email body content. `AssembleAndDeliverUseCase` passes a fixed-shape context to `templates.email_body_template_ref`. Specified future behavior: L1-AGGR-001 and L2-AGGR-003 describe a richer model where each `SubmitStageReport` may carry an `email_body_contribution` with a `position` enum (`BEFORE_STAGES_SUMMARY` / `AFTER_STAGES_SUMMARY`), and the assembly process orders contributions accordingly (L3-AGGR-005). The `Stage` aggregate already has an `email_body_context_json` column, so the storage side is ready; the use case just isn't reading it yet. Future work: extend `AssembleAndDeliverUseCase._render_email_body` to read each stage's `email_body_context_json`, group by `position`, and pass the structured payload into the template. Also wire the `position` field through the proto → command → aggregate path. Entirely additive; existing email body templates keep working because the v1 context fields are preserved.
- **Subscription granularity extensions** — beyond `GLOBAL`, `PIPELINE`, `TAG`: consider per-severity, per-submitter, or boolean combinations of existing granularities if use cases emerge.
- **Alternative delivery transports** — v1 delivers via SMTP. Future options include webhooks, direct API hooks into ticketing systems, and Slack/Teams relays.
- **R-DELIVER-002 — Per-subscriber email delivery** — v1 sends one email per run with the recipient list via BCC (adapter-configurable). Future option: one email per subscriber with per-subscriber personalization tokens in the body (`{{subscriber.name}}`, `{{subscriber.unsubscribe_url}}`). Requires per-subscriber rendering and a more involved failure model (one recipient fails, does the whole run fail?). Likely paired with R-DELIVER-001.
- **Streaming gRPC RPCs** — v1 uses unary RPCs only. Two distinct future extensions:
  - Server-streaming `WatchRun` endpoint for live run-progress streaming, if pipeline-side observers ever need it.
  - **R-DELIVER-003 — Streaming `SubmitStageReport`** — server-streaming variant for very large report contributions that exceed unary message size limits (gRPC's default is 4 MiB). Most stages fit comfortably; revisit only if concrete submitters hit the limit.
- **R-OBS-002 — Real-time dashboard updates** — the dashboard polls the REST API for run state. Future option: server-sent events or WebSocket push for instant updates on state transitions. Requires an event-bus abstraction the service doesn't currently have.
- **Custom WAL for in-flight state** — dependent on the profiling item above. Would replace the SQLite-backed in-flight state with an in-memory representation plus an append-only log file.

## Operations

- **High availability and multi-node** — v1 is single-node. Multi-node introduces leader election, shared state, and coordinated orphan sweeping; substantial scope.
- **R-PERS-001 — Cross-host replication** — v1 stores all state on the host running the service. Future option: Litestream-style continuous replication of the SQLite database to a standby host for disaster recovery. Requires a deployment-layer change only; no application code changes. Orthogonal to the outbox pattern (R-DELIVER-001) and to multi-node HA above (which is leader-election rather than DR-replication).
- **R-PERS-002 — Audit log retention pruning** — `AuditLog.record` inserts are not bounded; `observability.audit.retention_days` is in the config schema but not yet enforced by a running process. Future option: scheduled background task that deletes audit rows older than the retention window. Small; can piggyback on the same scheduler used for orphan sweeping. Distinct from "Audit log archival" below — pruning deletes; archival keeps the data elsewhere.
- **Air-gapped installer bundle** — a single-archive offline installer for ISOLAN deployment that bundles the Poetry-locked dependency tree, NSSM on Windows, and systemd unit on Linux.
- **Backup and restore tooling** — scripts to snapshot and restore the SQLite database and rendered-reports directory as an atomic unit.
- **Audit log archival** — once retention expires (see R-PERS-002), archive rather than delete, to satisfy long-term investigative needs.
- **Metrics dashboard templates** — ship pre-built Grafana dashboards in addition to the embedded in-service visualizations.
